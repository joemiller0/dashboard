 # Dashboard
This is my my most recent project.
Built with React, React-hooks, the Strava API, and an extremely small dependency list. I wanted to build as much as I could from scratch for experience. 

A training dashboard where I can show a simple bird's eye view of my entire program to my athletic coaches. 
It pulls from the Strava API, which itself has a link to my WHOOP data. This is the best it gets until WHOOP releases an API. 

The first completed feature is a calendar component which shows that bird's eye view mentioned above. 
Its two month-calendars, with days highlighted that have workout logs on them. This is where the data from Strava is displayed.
A modal appears to show the workout log details when the day is clicked. 
There were no pre-built npm packages used for the calendar component.  

## What I am adding now
I am currently refactoring
